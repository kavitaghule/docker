# Stage 1: Build an image with OpenJDK and any necessary Java dependencies
FROM openjdk:11 as java-builder

# Stage 2: Build the final image with Nginx and copy Java from the previous stage
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy Java from the java-builder stage to the final image
COPY --from=java-builder /usr/local/openjdk-11 /usr/local/openjdk-11

# Set environment variables for Java
ENV JAVA_HOME /usr/local/openjdk-11
ENV PATH $PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

# Your Nginx configurations and application setup can be added here
# For simplicity, let's just create a basic index.html file
RUN echo "Hello, Nginx with Java!" > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Expose the default Nginx port
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
