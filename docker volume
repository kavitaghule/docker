type of docker volume ->
Named Volumes: Named volumes are explicitly created and given a name. They are managed by Docker and are easy to
reference by name when creating and running containers.

Anonymous Volumes: Anonymous volumes are automatically created by Docker. They are not named and are typically used for 
temporary or disposable data.

Bind Mounts: Bind mounts allow you to mount a specific file or directory from the host machine into a container.
They provide direct access to the host's file system.
